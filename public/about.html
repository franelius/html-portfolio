<h1>Few words about me</h1>
<p>Hi!
  My name is Frane and currently i am in process of
  beacoming a web developer. 
</p>

<p>I live in Croatia and I decided as a teenager
  that I will become financially independent and create my own
  above average life. As a professional mountain biker, I am dedicated
  my goals and I am ready to devote all my energy to them.
  Web development is something that I find very interesting because of its way
  to express your creativity and create content in this super fast growing
  wonderworld we all call Internet.
</p>

<p>By taking the Udemy online course to become a senior web developer, i am
  looking forward to working on my web development skills and knowledge, with the aim of
  being able to create high quality websites for other people, businesses, etc.
